### **Biography**

I am a Ph.D. student at [**Zhongguancun Academy (ZGCA)**](http://bjzgca.edu.cn/) and [**Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)**](http://www.ia.cas.cn/), supervised by Prof. <b><a href="https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huangkaiqi" target="_blank">Kaiqi Huang</a></b>. Before that, I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology with overall ranking **1/449 (0.22%)** at the [**School of Computer Science**](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/) from [**Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)**](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in Jun. 2024. I am grateful to be growing up and studying with my twin brother **Xuzhao Li** (M.S. Student at BIT), which is a truly unique and special experience for me.

### **Research**

My research interests mainly lie in **Large Language Models**, **Data-centric AI**, and **Multi-modal Learning**. Particularly, I am interested in:

* **Large Language Models**: Large Language Models and Multi-modal Large Language Models Reasoning and Understanding
* **Data-centric AI**: Benchmark and Dataset Construction, Data Selection, Synthesis and Evaluation
* **Multi-modal Learning**: Video Reasoning and Understanding, including Video Question Answering, Video Captioning and Vision-Language Tracking
