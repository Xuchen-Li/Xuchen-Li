### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;I am an incoming Ph.D. student at <b><a href="http://english.ia.cas.cn/"> Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)</a></b>, supervised by <b><a href="https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~huangkaiqi?language=en">Prof. Kaiqi Huang</a></b> (IAPR Fellow) at <b><a href="http://www.crise.ia.ac.cn/">Center for Research on Intelligent System and Engineering (CRISE)</a></b>.
</p>
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;Currently, I am a fourth-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at <b><a href="https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/">School of Computer Science (SCS)</a></b> at <b><a href="https://www.bupt.edu.cn/">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)</a></b>.
</p>
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;I am very grateful to work with <b><a href="https://huuuuusy.github.io/">Dr. Shiyu Hu</a></b>, which has a significant impact on me. I am also grateful to grow up and study with my twin brother Xuzhao Li, which is a truly unique and special experience for me.

### 🔍️ Research

#### Visual Object Tracking (VOT)

- Research on visual object tracking algorithms within diverse scenes, aims to enhance the understanding and performance of single object tracking in various scenarios.
- Research on the robustness and generalization aspects of single object tracking algorithms, investigates the algorithms' ability to adapt across diverse scenarios, ensuring consistent and reliable performance.

#### Visual Language Tracking (VLT)

- Research on multi-modal tracking, addressing challenges related to integrating visual and linguistic information for improved tracking accuracy.
- Research on VLT extends to tasks involving comprehensive video understanding and encompasses efforts to enhance the algorithms' capability to interpret and contextualize objects in videos based on linguistic input.
- The exploration of human-computer interaction patterns employs Large Language Models (LLMs) in conjunction with visual language tracking as a proxy task, contributing to the development of interactions that are more intuitive and user-friendly.
